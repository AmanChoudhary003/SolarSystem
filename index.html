            The Solar System is made up of all the planets that orbit our Sun. In addition to planets, the Solar System also consists of moons, comets, asteroids, minor planets, dust and gas. The inner solar system contains the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.
            The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The planets of the outer solar system are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune (Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet).

                The sun is the largest object in the solar system. It is a middle-sized star and there are many other stars out in the universe just like it. Even though it is only a middle-sized star it is large enough to hold over 1 million Earth’s inside if it were
                hollow. The temperature on the sun is far too much for any living thing to bear. On the surface it is 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit and the core is a stunning 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit. But don’t worry we are over 90,000 million miles
                away, the sun could never reach us, at least not yet. The sun is a still a middle aged star and later in its life it will become a Red Giant.

                Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. As such, it circles the sun faster than all the other planets.Because the planet is so close to the sun, Mercury's surface temperature can reach a scorching 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius). However,
                since this world doesn't have much of a real atmosphere to entrap any heat, at night temperatures can plummet to minus 275 F (minus 170 C), a temperature swing of more than 1,100 degrees F (600 degree C), the greatest in the solar system.

                Venus, the second planet closest to the Sun and Earth’s closest neighbor, is known for its many wonders and harsh conditions. Venus is possibly the first planet discovered by humans and is said to have been first discovered in 17 B.C. by Babylonian astronomers.
                Venus is the first planet to be explored by spacecraft although many of these attempts have proven unsuccessful. Fortunately, more than twenty of the spacecraft explorations been proven successful, and through those we have gained knowledge
                about this wonder of the night sky. Known as “Earth’s twin”, Venus is very similar to Earth in composition, size, mass, and gravity. However, their temperatures are not so similar. The average temperature on Venus is a toasty 460 degrees
                Celsius (864 degrees Fahrenheit).Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system.

                The Earth was formed about 4.7 billion years ago. The Earth’s shape is very close to that of a sphere, not perfectly spherical. The Earth’s equatorial diameter is about 12,756 km, which is slightly larger than the polar diameter; about 12,714 km Surface
                Area of the Earth is 510,065,600 km2 of which 148,939,100 km2 (29.2 %) is land and 361,126,400 km2 (70.8 %) is water. The Earth rotates on its axis, an imaginary straight line through its centre. The two points where the axis of rotation
                intersects the Earth’s surface are called as the poles, one of them is called the North Pole and the other is known as the South Pole. One rotation with respect to Sun is completed in 24 hours, called a solar day. The Earth rotates in
                counter-clock direction or from left to right-or eastward direction. Rotation serves three reasons. First, the axis of rotation serves as a reference in setting up the geographic grid of latitude and longitude. Second, it provided a good
                measure of the passage of time, 24 hours or 1440 minutes or 86,400 seconds a day. Third, it greatly influenced the physical and life processes on Earth.

                Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system. Also, it is the second smallest planet in our solar system. The possibility of life on mars has aroused the interest of scientists for many years. A major reason for this interest is due to the
                similarity and proximity of the planet to Earth. Mars certainly gives some indications of the possibility of life.In the past, Mars used to look quite similar to Earth. Billions of years ago, there were certainly similarities between Mars
                and Earth. Furthermore, scientists believe that Mars once had a huge ocean. This ocean, experts believe, covered more of the planet’s surface than Earth’s own oceans do so currently. Moreover, Mars was much warmer in the past that it is
                currently. Most noteworthy, warm temperature and water are two major requirements for life to exist. So, there is a high probability that previously there was life on Mars.

                Jupiter is one of the Sun's most interesting planets. Jupiter has many intriguing properties, which differ from those of Earth and other planets. It has many satellites uncommon to others in the solar system. It even helps to sustain life on Earth. Jupiter
                may seem like an ordinary planet, but in reality Jupiter may be one of the most interesting planetary bodies in the galaxy. Jupiter's physical attributes is one of the reasons it is so fascinating. Unlike Earth, Jupiter is composed of
                gases, and has a molten center. It does not have rocky layers such as Earth or Mars. It is a ball of gas with rock and sediment debris orbiting it. Jupiter actually looks like a squished ball because of its high rotational spin. A Jupiter
                day is equal to 9 Earth hours and 45 minutes and a Jupiter year take more than twice as long as an Earth year.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the
                larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition
                of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224.2 °C),
                and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.

                It has eight moons, six of which were found by Voyager 2. A day on Neptune is 16 hours and 6. 7 minutes. Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle, of the Berlin Observatory.

                Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Solar System. Its formal name is 134340 Pluto. The dwarf planet is the ninth largest body that moves around the Sun. ... Pluto is very far from the Sun, so its temperature is very low. The average temperature on Pluto is
                -223 degrees Celsius. Minor planet category: dwarf planet, TNO, Absolute magnitude (H): −0.7 Known satellites:. Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people
                learned that Pluto had a small size.[8] Later, in the early 21st century, the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered. Eris was initially believed to be 27% larger than Pluto, but was later found to be slightly
                smaller.[9] On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a definition to the word "planet" for the first time. By this definition, Pluto was not a planet anymore. It became a "dwarf planet" along with Eris and Ceres
